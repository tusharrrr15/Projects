# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning. It leverages historical transaction data to build a predictive model that can differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The aim is to enhance financial security by providing an intelligent fraud detection mechanism.




## Features

- Preprocessing of highly imbalanced credit card transaction data.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Visualization of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
- Scalable approach for real-world fraud detection systems.


## Tech Stack

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Modeling Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which contains anonymized credit card transactions with features like V1, V2, ..., V28 and the Class label indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).

## Workflow

- Data loading and exploration.

- Data preprocessing (handling imbalance, scaling features).

- Model training using different algorithms.

- Performance evaluation and comparison.

- Fraud transaction prediction.

## Results

- Demonstrated the effectiveness of ML models in fraud detection.

- Achieved strong performance in identifying fraudulent transactions despite imbalanced data.










## Usage

1) **Clone the repository:**
